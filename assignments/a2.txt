change a2 due date to Mar 6, so could include a question from L14 (symbolic execution)
a3 due date end of term

* Q1: could reuse a PMD question
* fuzzing: Q2-Q5
* Q2: mutation-based fuzzing
* Q3: grammar-based fuzzing (ask questions like the ones I was thinking about for the midterm)
* Q4: property-based testing
* Q5: reducing inputs---do a reduction manually; put a case where the test case is actually context sensitive (e.g. operations that write to state)
* Q6: Symbolic execution
