Python's \texttt{decimal} module supports ``decimal fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic''.
Write a \texttt{decimal\_fuzzer()} function that creates a \texttt{decimal.Decimal} as follows:
it draws between 1 and 5 decimal digits to form an integral part, then between 0 and 3 decimal digits
to form a fractional part, and a random sign (+ or -). The skeleton includes class \texttt{RandomFuzzer}
in \texttt{fuzzer.py}.
